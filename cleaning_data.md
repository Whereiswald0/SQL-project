What issues will you address by cleaning the data?

The two biggest ones will be data normalization and removing duplicates.
This is especially true for the columns that appear unformatted, such as prices, and columns which may represent intervals or times.



Queries:
Below, provide the SQL queries you used to clean your data.

--first, generate a temp table of all fields in the analytics csv
~~~sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_analytics AS (
SELECT 
	DISTINCT visitid AS sessionid, --distinct is called to reduce the number of duplicates, visitid renamed to sessionid to try to differenciate from other fields
	TO_TIMESTAMP(visitid) AS visit_date, --since visitid is generated from the users timestamp (which can be seen when comparing this cast to the date), a more       
	(CASE WHEN timeonsite IS NULL THEN '00:00:00'                                                                     --accurate time can be generated this way
	ELSE timeonsite END) timeonsite, 
	visitnumber,
	fullvisitorid AS visitorid, --fullvisitorid was a bit unwieldly, since visitid was changed to session ID, dropped the 'full'.
	channelgrouping,
	socialengagementtype,
	(CASE WHEN bounces IS NULL THEN '0'  -- the following casts are just to remove null values
	ELSE bounces END) bounces,
	(CASE WHEN units_sold IS NULL THEN 0
	ELSE units_sold END) units_sold,
	(CASE WHEN unit_price IS NULL THEN '0' 
	 ELSE ROUND((unit_price/1000000),2) END) AS unit_price, --creates unit_price in a better, more legible format
	(CASE WHEN revenue IS NULL THEN '0' 
	ELSE ROUND((revenue/1000000),2) END) AS revenue --same

ORDER BY sessionid)

Call this whole table, examine the results, then move on to all_sessions. 32 columns, lots of data
